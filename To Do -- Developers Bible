To Do:

Big idea:
- 2D side scroller

- Revolved around multidirectional movement with simple combat (Mario cave man)
 - Options: Constant Side scroll player must keep up with?
   Level scrolls with player? Limited backwards movement?

 - Environment
  - Cave
   (Potential images: http://imgur.com/a/OnG0f)
   - black boarders around cave
   - obstacles, boxes, pitfalls, headroom limiters (low ceiling), Cave in? Rock fall?
   - Lighting, could be important torches and lanterns? Flashlights?
     Overall not necessary, could be kept consistent.
   - Interactions: power-ups (no damage, health recharge?)

 - Player
  - Player movements
   - Basic four directions
   - Special Moves: jumping, ducking
   - possible acceleration/ deceleration

  - Player Abilities
   - Attack

  - Player Status 
   - health status (percentage, hits taken (three strikes you're out?))
   - status of tools (ammunition if projectiles)
   - optional: progress indicator (slide bar?)

- Tile based map generation
  - tile size
  - tile types
  - tile traversal

IMPORTANT STUFFS:

Graphic Generation:
-Procedural
-Vertical


Player and World Mechanics: 
-Inputs
 - Basic Input Finished
 - Directional keys
 - Action key (attacking)




Player Interactions:
-Collisions
-Attacks



Flavor (to be added later):
