To Do:

Big idea:
- 2D side scroller

- Revolved around multidirectional movement with simple combat
 - Options: Constant Side scroll player must keep up with?
   Level scrolls with player? Limited backwards movement?

 - Enviroment
  - Cave
   - black boarders around cave
   - obstacles, boxes, pitfalls, headroom limiters (low ceiling), Cave in? Rock fall?
   - Lighting, could be important torches and lanterns? Flashlights?
     Overall not necessary, could be kept consistent.
 

 -Player movements
  - Basic four directions
  - Special Moves: jumping, ducking
  - possible acceleration/ deceleration

- UI Elements
 - Player Status 
  - health status (percentage, hits taken (three strikes you're out?))
  - status of tools (ammunition if projectiles, )
  - optional: progress indicator (slide bar?)


- Tile based map generation
  -tile size
  -tile types
   -environmental interactions: power-ups (no damage, health recharge?)


Graphic Generation:
-Procedural
-Vertical


Player and World Mechanics: 
-Inputs




Player Interactions:
-Collisions
-Attacks



Flavor (to be added later):
